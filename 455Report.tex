This report analyzes what it takes to become a March Madness Champion. We are taking a look at data from the past, and at winners from the past to see if there is anything specific that points to a team winning the tournament.

\section*{Introduction}
Throughout this report, we will analyze past data on March Madness teams, their seasons, and their performance in the tournament. We have gathered data from kaggle.com and broken it down to find the most useful predictors of a team winning the tournament.
\section*{Data Summary}
On Kaggle's website, we found data that gave us a look at the teams who are qualified for the March Madness tournament. Each team is assigned a four digit code that is consistent from season to season and in each data set. This allows us to easily manipulate and analyze the data.\\

We begin by looking at the data that has been collected season to season.\\

We follow up by looking at the data from previous tournaments to see which factors effect a team's chances of winning.
